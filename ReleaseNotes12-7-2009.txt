Release notes 12/7/2009

This document is divided into three sections:

1. Intro
2. Structure
3. Data dictionary

================================================================================

Section 1: Intro

This release contains a selection of xml schemas which exist at the boundaries of the Frontier Election System(tm). The files define schemas for data import into the system from an external voter registration system as well as election result output.

Sample data files are also included to demonstrate how the schemas might be used in practice.

Please contact us at SourceCode@sequoiavote.com if you have any questions or comments regarding this release.

Section 2: Structure

The following is a brief description of each file:

DistrictImport.xsd
- Defines a schema for importing district data into the database.

PrecinctImport.xsd
- Defines a schema for importing precinct data into the database. Precincts have portions (also known as splits) according to which districts are assigned.

PartyImport.xsd
- Defines a schema for importing party data into the database.

PortionStatImport.xsd
- Defines a schema for importing portion statistical information into the database. Statistical information refers to the number of voters registered to a particular party (or no party) assigned to a particular portion.

Results.xsd
- Defines a schema for communicating the voter records from a voting device to the tally process. A single results file is synonymous with a voting device cartridge and contains election modes which contain voter records. Voter records contain contests and will only show candidates when they have been selected by a voter record. A contest with no selections (an undervote) will show no child candidates. Additionally, we have outstack conditions at both the voter record and contest levels to indicate discrepancies with a particular ballot or ballot contest which require post-process adjudication.

The schemas are located in /XmlData/Schemas/[DataImport]|[Results]
The samples are locating in /XmlData/Samples/[DataImport]|[Results]
